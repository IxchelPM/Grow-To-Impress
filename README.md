GROW TO IMPRESS
Inspiration
As first-generation college students, we know firsthand the challenges of navigating the tech world without family guidance. Our experiences have driven us to create a platform that empowers young girls—especially those from underrepresented backgrounds—to grow with confidence and reach their full potential.

Growing up in the U.S. as the daughter of Mexican immigrants (Ixchel Peralta-Martinez) and as a Colombian who moved to the U.S. (Maria Duran), we witnessed limited career paths for women in our families—often domestic work or labor. While we are proud of our roots, we’re committed to expanding what's possible for girls like us.

GROW TO IMPRESS is inspired by the game Dress to Impress—but with a twist. Instead of outfits, we focus on confidence, growth, and life-changing skills. Our name reflects a mission: to help young women grow into the best versions of themselves.

This project is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. We focus on:

Leadership Readiness: Equipping girls with the tools to become future leaders.

Tech Enablement: Leveraging AI to provide personalized guidance and support.

Gender Equality: Creating space for girls to confidently pursue careers in male-dominated fields like tech and data science.

What It Does
GROW TO IMPRESS is a web app divided into four empowering sections:

1. Learn How To
A step-by-step roadmap of six essential 21-day challenges—based on the science of habit formation. Girls can build vital life skills through guided, trackable programs:

Why the name IXIA?
It’s inspired by:

“IA” = Inteligencia Artificial (Spanish for Artificial Intelligence)

IXIA supports girls throughout their learning journey—helping them stay on track, motivated, and inspired.

Real women. Real journeys. Real impact.

This section highlights the diverse stories of women in tech and leadership:

Photo + Story Cards – Share personal narratives of struggle and success.

Diverse Voices – Showcase women from varied backgrounds and life stages.

Connectable Profiles – Link to their LinkedIn or other platforms for real-world networking.

Why it matters:

How We Built It
Tech Stack
Frontend: React

Backend: Flask

Deployment: Project IDX

AI Models: Developed in Google Colab using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, integrated via API into the web app

Debugging & Testing
Gemini Advance – Used to debug code, refine prompts, and ensure a smooth UX

Design & Branding
Logo: Created with Canva to reflect our identity

Visuals: Generated using Imagen 3 (prompted with delicate, pastel, nature-inspired themes)

AI Documentation & Planning
Google AI Developer Docs: Guided our API usage, JSON formatting, and prompt engineering

Google AI Studio: Helped refine outputs with example prompts and “Get Code” tools

Ideation & UX Strategy
Our initial brainstorm defined:

How to design for clarity, motivation, and usability

The design evolved continuously, focusing on user experience, accessibility, and inspiration.

Chatbot Safety
We used default safety settings and parameters (e.g., temperature) for IXIA to ensure it stays safe, respectful, and aligned with community standards.

GROW TO IMPRESS is more than a web app—it’s a mission, a movement, and a support system. By equipping young girls with skills, confidence, and mentorship, we’re not just closing the gender gap—we’re building a stronger, more inclusive future.

Let’s grow. Let’s impress.
